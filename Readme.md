# Bookmark Manager
This is a modified and restored version of the extension 'Bookmark Manager' by Google. Its based on the version 2.2018.815.1147. I take no credit for the development of the orginal of this extension (still found on the webstore using the link below).

The original version of the extension was unusable on the 20th of July 2018 and depricated on the 16th of August 2018.

Webstore version (doesn't work): https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bookmark-manager/gmlllbghnfkpflemihljekbapjopfjik

Extension archive: https://crx.dam.io/ext/gmlllbghnfkpflemihljekbapjopfjik.html

A full rewrite is in development, feel free to check it out on the [rebuild](https://github.com/rtm516/Bookmark-Manager/tree/rebuild) branch, any pull requests adding features or fixing bugs are welcome and a TODO list is in the readme.
